## MNIST Digit Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create new handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset. 

### Project Overview

The project leverages Keras and TensorFlow to implement a GAN with two key components:

* **Generator:** A neural network that learns to produce realistic digit images.
* **Discriminator:** A neural network that attempts to distinguish between real MNIST digits and images generated by the generator.

By training these models in competition, the generator progressively improves its ability to create realistic digits, while the discriminator becomes better at identifying fakes.

### Model Architectures

The following images illustrate the architectures of both the generator and discriminator models:

* **Generator Architecture (Generator_arch.png):** This image depicts the layers and connections within the generator model, showcasing how it transforms random noise into a synthetic handwritten digit.

* **Discriminator Architecture (Discriminator_arch.png):** This image visualizes the architecture of the discriminator model, highlighting how it analyzes an image and determines its likelihood of being a real MNIST digit.

**Note:** These image filenames are just examples, you can replace them with your actual filenames.

### Training Process

The training process involves iteratively improving both models. The generator tries to "fool" the discriminator by generating increasingly realistic digits. The discriminator, in turn, refines its ability to detect fakes based on the generator's progress.

### Results and Evaluation

The project evaluates the success of the GAN by assessing the quality and realism of the generated digits. Visualizations of generated samples alongside real MNIST digits can be used for comparison. Additionally, metrics like Inception Score (measuring image quality) or Frechet Inception Distance (measuring similarity to real data) can be employed for quantitative evaluation.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of GANs for generating new and realistic data, specifically handwritten digits in this case. Further exploration can involve experimenting with different network architectures, hyperparameters, and loss functions to optimize performance.
